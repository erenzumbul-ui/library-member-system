# Python OOP Basics Project

This project demonstrates the fundamental concepts of Python programming using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). It covers the following key topics:

1. **Library**: Shows how to use external libraries for additional functionalities.
2. **Class**: Demonstrates defining classes and creating objects.
3. **OOP**: Illustrates Object-Oriented Programming concepts with real-life examples.
4. **Variable**: Explains how to store and use data within a program.
5. **Function**: Demonstrates how to define reusable blocks of code.
6. **Condition**: Shows decision-making in programs using if-else statements.
7. **Loop**: Illustrates repetitive tasks using for loops.
8. **Function Parameters**: Demonstrates passing values to functions for dynamic behavior.

## Example: Library System

The project includes a simple library system where `Book` and `Library` classes are used to manage books. The system demonstrates all the OOP concepts along with variables, functions, loops, conditions, and function parameters.

## How to Run

1. Make sure Python is installed on your system.
2. Copy the code into a `.py` file.
3. Run the script using the command: `python filename.py`

This project is intended for educational purposes to understand basic programming concepts in Python.
